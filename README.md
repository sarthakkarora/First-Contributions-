# First-Contributions

This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

# Forking:

- Forking refers to creating a copy of a repository on GitHub under your own GitHub account.
- Forking is typically done when you want to contribute to someone else's project or experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
- When you fork a repository, you have your own separate copy of the project that you can modify independently.

# Cloning:

- Cloning refers to creating a local copy of a repository on your own computer.
- When you clone a repository, you download the entire repository, including all its files, commit history, and branches, to your local machine.
- Cloning allows you to work on the project locally, make changes, and then push those changes back to the remote repository (usually on GitHub).



# Forking and Cloning Repositories

# Forking a Repository

### 1. Create a Fork
   - To create a fork of a repository on GitHub, navigate to the repository's page and click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.
   - This action creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Forked Repository
   - After forking, clone the forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command followed by the URL of your forked repository.
   - Example: 
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repository.git
     ```

### 3. Configure Remote
   - By default, Git names the remote pointing to the original repository as `origin`. You need to configure a new remote pointing to your fork.
   - Navigate into the cloned repository directory:
     ```
     cd forked-repository
     ```
   - Add a new remote named `origin` pointing to your forked repository:
     ```
     git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/forked-repository.git
     ```

# Cloning a Repository

### 1. Clone Repository
   - To clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine, use the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository.
   - Example:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/original-owner/original-repository.git
     ```

### 2. Navigate into Cloned Repository
   - Once cloned, navigate into the directory of the cloned repository using the `cd` command.
   - Example:
     ```
     cd original-repository
     ```

### 3. Configure Remote (Optional)
   - By default, Git sets the remote name as `origin`. You can directly work with this remote if you want to push changes to the original repository.
   - If you want to push changes to your own fork, you may configure a new remote pointing to your forked repository as described in the forking section.

# How to Translate English Files into Multiple Languages in Git

To update your English files and translate them into the given languages in a Git repository, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Identify Files to Translate**: Determine which files in your repository contain English text that needs to be translated. These could be README files, documentation files, or any other text-based content.

2. **Create Translation Files**: For each language you want to translate into (Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Kannada, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Marwari), create a new file with the translated content. For example, if you have a file named `README.md` in English, you can create separate files like `README.hi.md`, `README.gu.md`, `README.pa.md`, and so on, for each language.

3. **Translate Content**: Open each English file and translate its content into the corresponding language. You can use translation tools or seek the help of native speakers to ensure accuracy.

4. **Save Translation Files**: Save the translated files with appropriate filenames and extensions, following the pattern `<original_filename>.<language_code>.md`. For example, `README.md` would become `README.hi.md` for Hindi, `README.gu.md` for Gujarati, and so on.

5. **Stage and Commit Changes**: Use Git to stage and commit the changes to your repository. 

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 


 By following these steps, you can update your English files and translate them into the specified languages in your Git repository. Make sure to maintain consistency in file naming conventions and keep the translations organized within the repository structure.


# Where to go from here?

You can also create a new branch in your forked repository to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch. This allows you to isolate your changes until they are ready to be merged into the main project.

Congrats! You just completed the standard _fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request_ workflow that you'll often encounter as a contributor!
